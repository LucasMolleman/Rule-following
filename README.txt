Data and code associated with the paper "Why people follow rules" by Simon Gaechter, Lucas Molleman, and Daniele Nosenzo.

The Data folder contains all experimental data in an xslx file. The last tab in the file contains an extensive legend.

The file "Demographics all experimental participants" loops over all xlsx Data tabs and summarizes demographics. 

The file "Analysis code" contains all analyses, which should be conducted in R. It also contains code for generating the Figures in the paper. Changing the folder structure will corrupt the code.

The code will produce the statistics reported in the paper, and will produce the Supplementary Tables as html files (which will be added to the Data folder).

The script "Simulations rule-following.R" contains the agent-based simulations reported in Fig. 4E of the main text of the paper.

The png files 'angel' and 'demon' are used in the scripts creating the figures.
